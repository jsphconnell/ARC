### This src directory contains all solution source code for our three selected tasks.
All tasks and solutions were worked on by @jsphconnell and @Enaitz.
This folder also contains a data folder containing the task json files and also a module named **arc_utils.py** for common code used in each solution.

The three task files we have picked are:
  - 0ca9ddb6.json
  - 0d3d703e.json
  - 1e0a9b12.json
  
  ### Task 1: 0ca9ddb6.json
  
  The task involves adding yellow and orange squares in set positions around red and blue squares to create flower like shapes.
  
  The solution file for this task is named **solution_0ca9ddb6.py** and can be run from this directory as follows:
  ```
  python solution_0ca9ddb6.py data\0ca9ddb6.json
  ```
  The solution then prints the output grid for each train and test input in the form of a numpy 2d array with a new line between them.
  
  ### Task 2: 0d3d703e.json
  
  This task involved reading the input 3x3 grid and converting all colours to different ones for example. Green -> Yellow.
  
  The solution file for this task is named **solution_0d3d703e.py** and can be run from this directory as follows:
  ```
  python solution_0d3d703e.py data\0d3d703e.json
  ```
 The solution then prints the output grid for each train and test input in the form of a numpy 2d array with a new line between them.
 
 ### Task 3: 1e0a9b12.json
 
 This task involves dropping all colour squares down to the bottom of the grid, stacking them up. Similar to Tetris.
 
 The solution file for this task is named **solution_1e0a9b12.py** and can be run from this directory as follows:
 ```
 python solution_1e0a9b12.py data\1e0a9b12.json
 ```
 The solution then prints the output grid for each train and test input in the form of a numpy 2d array with a new line between them.
