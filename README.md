The three task files we have picked are:
  - 0ca9ddb6.json
  - 0d3d703e.json
  - 1e0a9b12.json

The src folder will contain the solutions for each task named as follows:
  - solution_0ca9ddb6.json
  - solution_0d3d703e.json
  - solution_1e0a9b12.json

# Running solution files
All solution files can be ran as follows from the python command line:

```sh
$ python solution_0ca9ddb6.json path/to/0ca9ddb6.json
```

Each solution file will output a 2d numpy grid containing the output grid for every train and test input in the input json, will a blank like between them.
