# CT5148 - Programming and Tools for Artificial Intelligence - Online
## Assignment 3

This repository is a fork of the [ARC](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC) repository and will contain hand written python solutions for three tasks in the ARC/data/training directory.

The three task files we have picked are:
  - 0ca9ddb6.json
  - 0d3d703e.json
  - 1e0a9b12.json

The src folder will contain the solutions for each task named as follows:
  - solution_0ca9ddb6.py
  - solution_0d3d703e.py
  - solution_1e0a9b12.py

# Running solution files
All solution files can be ran as follows from the python command line:

```sh
$ python solution_0ca9ddb6.json path/to/0ca9ddb6.json
```

Each solution file will output a 2d numpy array containing the output grid for every train and test input from the input json.
There will a blank like between each output grid.
